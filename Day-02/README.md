## we learnt about lan,wan,nat which are:
### Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used in networking to modify network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The primary purpose of NAT is to improve security and decrease the number of IP addresses an organization needs. 
### A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking. WANs are typically used to connect multiple local area networks (LANs) and other types of networks so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations.
### Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology used in computer networking to modify network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. NAT is commonly implemented in routers and firewalls to enable multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the Internet, thereby conserving public IP addresses and enhancing network security
