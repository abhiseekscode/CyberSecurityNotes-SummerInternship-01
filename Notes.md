Day 1 – What Cyber‑security Is
Learn what “cyber‑security” means: keeping computers, phones, and data safe from bad people online. See why every company and person now needs protection.

Day 2 – How Hackers Get In
Look at common tricks hackers use, like fake emails (phishing), flooding a website (DDoS), or sweet‑talking people (social engineering). Understand that attacks often start with just one careless click.

Day 3 – Why Safety Matters
Hear real stories of big hacks that cost firms millions. Notice how a single breach can shut down services, hurt a brand, and even get a company fined by the law.

Day 4 – The CIA Rule
Remember three big goals:
• Confidentiality – only the right people read the data.
• Integrity – data stays correct, not changed by hackers.
• Availability – systems stay up and running when needed.

Day 5 – Layers of Defense
One lock is not enough. Use many layers: firewall on the edge, antivirus on laptops, strong passwords, and staff training. If one layer fails, others still protect you.

Day 6 – Judging Risk
Risk is the chance that a threat meets a weak spot and causes harm. List your top weak points, guess the damage they could cause, then decide what to fix first.

Day 7 – Quick Review
Take a short quiz and write a few lines about what you found most eye‑opening this week.

Day 8 – Strong Passwords
Long, unique pass‑phrases beat short messy ones. A manager app can store hundreds so you don’t reuse the same password everywhere.

Day 9 – Two‑Step Login (MFA)
Add a second check—like a code from your phone—after your password. Even if someone steals the password, they still can’t log in without that code.

Day 10 – Kinds of Malware
Meet the main “bugs”: viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware. See how ransomware locks your files and asks for money.

Day 11 – Fighting Malware
Install antivirus, let it scan, and watch it quarantine a test file. Notice how updates give it new “signatures” to spot fresh threats.

Day 12 – Network Basics
Get the idea of IP addresses (like house numbers) and ports (like apartment doors). Firewalls act as guards that let good traffic pass and stop the bad.

Day 13 – Alarms and Zones
IDS tools ring an alarm when they see odd traffic; IPS tools can block it. Splitting a network into zones (VLANs or a DMZ) keeps an intruder from roaming freely.

Day 14 – Hands‑On Lab
Capture a bit of web traffic with Wireshark and test removing a harmless sample virus. Seeing the tools in action makes the theory stick.

Day 15 – How Websites Get Hacked
Web apps speak HTTP. If they trust any input, attackers slip in scripts or commands. Secure sites check and clean everything a user sends.

Day 16 – XSS and CSRF
XSS lets attackers inject sneaky code that runs in other people’s browsers. CSRF tricks you into clicking a link that acts like you. Learn simple fixes such as input filters and CSRF tokens.

Day 17 – Writing Safer Code
Always validate user input and use prepared statements for database queries. Following the OWASP Top 10 list helps avoid the worst web flaws.

Day 18 – Who Gets Access (IAM)
Identity and Access Management means making sure only the right users log in and only see what they need. Think “need‑to‑know.”

Day 19 – Roles, Not Individuals
Instead of giving Bob 12 separate rights, put Bob in the “HR‑Manager” role. Change the role once and everyone in it updates automatically.

Day 20 – Plan for Trouble
An Incident Response Plan lists steps: get ready, find the breach, stop it, clean up, bring systems back, then learn from it. Having a plan beats panicking.

Day 21 – Fake Breach Drill
Act out a mini hack scenario, decide who calls whom, what logs to check, and write a short incident report. Practice now saves time later.

Day 22 – Watching Logs (SIEM)
A SIEM tool pulls logs from many devices and spots patterns that look dangerous. A single dashboard helps teams catch attacks early.

Day 23 – Behavior Alerts
User & Entity Behavior tools flag odd actions—like a staff laptop logging in from two countries within minutes. Such “impossible travel” hints at a stolen account.

Day 24 – Pen‑Testing Steps
Penetration testing is “friendly hacking.” Steps: gather info, scan, try exploits, and write a clear report so owners can fix holes.

Day 25 – Scan for Holes
Run Nmap to map open ports and Nessus/OpenVAS to list known vulnerabilities. Each finding has a severity score that guides patching.

Day 26 – Safer Network Design
Put public‑facing servers in a DMZ, separate critical data on its own VLAN, and force all admin work through a jump box. Good design limits blast radius.

Day 27 – Cloud Safety Basics
In AWS or Azure, the provider secures the hardware; you must secure your data, users, and settings. Turn on logging and use least‑privilege roles.

Day 28 – Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
APTs are skilled groups that stay hidden for months. Study a famous case (like APT29) to see their slow, careful methods and how to spot them.

Day 29 – Mini Project
Choose a test site or VM, run a scan, attempt a safe exploit, and write a short, clear vulnerability report with fixes.

Day 30 – Wrap‑Up & Share
Summarize everything learned, push notes, labs, and the project report to GitHub, and list next steps (e.g., try Hack The Box or study for CompTIA Security+).
